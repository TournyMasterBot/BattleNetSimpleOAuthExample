# SimpleOAuthExample
This repository is intended  as an extremely simplified OAuth example. It is not necessarily best practices as it is intended to be a one-file-app to demo OAuth.

- Create an application at https://develop.battle.net/access/clients
- Fill out the client id / credentials view page
- Update the HomeController BlizzardOAuthCallback method to execute your sample requests
- Modify request flow as desired to use in your own application.
